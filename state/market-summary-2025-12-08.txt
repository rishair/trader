================================================================================
MARKET CHARACTERISTICS BY CATEGORY
================================================================================

HIGH VOLUME MARKETS (Good for momentum):
  - 8+ cuts: Volume = $1.38M (dominates sentiment)
  - 2 cuts: Volume = $14k (baseline expectation)
  - Hike: Volume = $10k (tail risk)

SPREAD MARKETS (For arbitrage):
  - 3-7 cuts: Combined volume = $17.8k
  - Paired against 2-cut baseline for relative value betting
  - Lower volume = wider spreads, harder to exit

LIQUIDITY DISTRIBUTION:
  - Most liquid: 6 cuts ($372k) and 5 cuts ($296k)
  - Liquid: 4 cuts ($155k), 7 cuts ($234k), 3 cuts ($82k)
  - Less liquid: 2 cuts ($81k), 8+ cuts ($202k), Hike ($60k)

PARADOX: Higher liquidity in lower-volume markets indicates market-maker hedging
         Suggests institutional traders are using spreads, not directional bets

Will 8+ Fed rate cuts happen in 2025?         70    Volume leader, good liquidity, clear sentiment
Will 2 Fed rate cuts happen in 2025?          70    Baseline consensus, good volume, liquid
Fed rate hike in 2025?                        70    Binary directional, solid metrics
Will 3 Fed rate cuts happen in 2025?          55    Spread market, medium volume

Will 6 Fed rate cuts happen in 2025?          55    Spread market, very low volume

OVERALL SUITABILITY FOR MOMENTUM: MODERATE (50/100)

Why not higher?
- 45 hours to expiration (no time for trends)
- Single binary event (all resolve together)
- Correlated outcomes (can't trade independently)
- Known deadline (no information edge from timing)

================================================================================
TRADING RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

BEST POSITIONS (If trading these markets):
1. 8+ Cuts Market (516729)
   - Primary sentiment indicator
   - Most liquid for entry/exit
   - Use as index of Fed expectations
   - Action: Monitor intraday (Dec 9-10 morning)

2. 2 Cuts Market (516725)
   - Consensus baseline
   - Hedge or counter against 8+ cuts
   - Good entry/exit liquidity
   - Action: Take directional position based on news

3. 2-Cut vs 3-Cut Spread (516725 vs 516726)
   - Arbitrage if pricing diverges
   - Hedged position (reduces binary risk)
   - Action: If 2 cuts at 60%, expect 3 cuts at 35-40%

DO NOT RECOMMEND:
- 4, 5, 6, 7 cuts markets individually (too illiquid)
- Holding past Dec 9 6:00 PM UTC (gap risk on announcement)
- Scaling large positions (spreads will widen)

================================================================================
KEY CONSTRAINTS FOR MOMENTUM ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Time Constraint:
  - Only 45 hours to expiration
  - Momentum needs time to develop
  - Better timeframe: 5-30 days minimum

Event Risk:
  - Single announcement Dec 10 @ 12:00 UTC
  - Market will gap significantly on news
  - Trend following impossible near event

Correlation Problem:
  - If 2 cuts market moves up, others cascade
  - Can't identify independent signals
  - Spread analysis more useful than momentum

Data Limitations:
  - Current prices not available (API issue)
  - No historical price data (can't see recent trend)
  - Volume data 24h old (real-time data needed)

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE OPPORTUNITIES
================================================================================

If you want to find better markets for momentum analysis:

1. SEARCH BROADER: Query for markets closing by Dec 31 (not just Dec 15)
2. DIVERSIFY CATEGORIES: Sports, politics, crypto events likely have longer runways
3. EXTEND WINDOW: 5-7 day running markets are ideal (current = 2 days)
4. FILTER BY VOLUME: Only look at markets with 10k+ in daily volume
5. TRACK SENTIMENT: Use volume distribution (like the 8+ cuts phenomenon) to find consensus breaks

================================================================================
NEXT ACTIONS
================================================================================

Immediate (before Dec 10):
  1. Monitor 8+ cuts market price action
  2. Track Fed speaker commentary (Dec 8-9)
  3. Check market reaction to any CPI/jobs data
  4. Close positions 1-2 hours before announcement

After Dec 10 (post-announcement):
  1. Analyze accuracy of market predictions vs actual Fed decision
  2. Check if 8+ cuts market was correct direction
  3. Look for markets that had best predictive signal
  4. Search for next set of closing markets (likely election 2026)

System Improvements:
  1. Debug CLOB API price fetching
  2. Build historical price tracking (6-hour snapshots)
  3. Extend search to broader date ranges automatically
  4. Add category filtering (sports, politics, crypto)
  5. Build real-time WebSocket feed for price updates
