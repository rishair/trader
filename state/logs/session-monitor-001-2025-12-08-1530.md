# Session Log: monitor-001 (Momentum Hypothesis Scan)

**Date**: 2025-12-08 15:30 UTC
**Task ID**: monitor-001
**Type**: monitor
**Duration**: ~15 minutes

## Objective
Scan for markets closing within 7 days to track price movements for momentum hypothesis (hyp-002).

## Actions Taken

### 1. Market Scan
- Searched Polymarket API and web for markets closing by Dec 15, 2025
- Found 8 Fed rate decision markets (all close Dec 10, 12:00 UTC)
- Fetched prices for end-of-year markets (Largest Company, Time Person of Year)

### 2. Findings

**Fed Rate Markets (Close Dec 10)**:
- 8 markets, all Fed-related (2-cuts, 3-cuts, etc.)
- 97% volume ($1.38M/day) concentrated in "8+ cuts" market
- NOT ideal for momentum testing: 45-hour window too short, binary event

**End-of-Year Markets (Close Dec 31)**:
| Market | Leader | % | Runner-up | % |
|--------|--------|---|-----------|---|
| Largest Company | NVDA | 90% | AAPL | 8.7% |
| Time POTY | AI | 39% | Jensen Huang | 21% |

### 3. Position Update
- AAPL: Entry 9¢ → Current 8.7¢ (-3.3%, -$16.65 unrealized)
- No exit triggers hit (TP: 20¢, SL: 4¢)
- Thesis intact: 23 days to resolution

### 4. Hypothesis Update
- hyp-002 status: proposed → testing
- Established baseline prices for 3 tracking markets
- Will compare prices over coming days to identify momentum patterns

## Key Observations

1. **Momentum harder to test than expected**: Markets near resolution tend to be at extreme prices (90%+, <5%), leaving little room for momentum to develop. Need to identify markets in 30-70% range approaching resolution.

2. **Volume concentration is informative**: In Fed markets, 97% of volume in one contract (8+ cuts) suggests this is the sentiment indicator. The rest are spread/hedge vehicles.

3. **Our AAPL position shows slight negative drift**: Moved from 9% → 8.7% (down from 89% to 90% on NVDA). This could support momentum hypothesis (price drifting toward eventual winner) but n=1 and within noise.

## State Changes
- Updated hyp-002: status → testing, added 3 evidence entries, tracking 3 markets
- Updated portfolio: AAPL price 8.5¢ → 8.7¢, unrealized P&L recalculated
- Created market search data files in state/

## Follow-up Tasks
- Monitor tracked markets daily to build momentum dataset
- Post-Fed resolution (Dec 10): Analyze if momentum continued to resolution
- Consider opening positions in markets with 40-60% probabilities closing within 2 weeks
