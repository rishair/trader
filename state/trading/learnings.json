The gamma-api.polymarket.com and data-api.polymarket.com do not include leaderboard endpoints.\n\n**Available Documented APIs**:\n- Gamma API (gamma-api.polymarket.com): Markets, events, tags - NO leaderboard\n- Data API (data-api.polymarket.com): /positions, /trades, /activity, /holders, /value - trader-specific but NOT leaderboard rankings\n- CLOB API (clob.polymarket.com): Trading operations only\n\n**Alternative Access Methods**:\n1. **Web Scraping**: The leaderboard at polymarket.com/leaderboard/* is rendered via Next.js SSG. Can be scraped using Selenium/BeautifulSoup (see JeremyWhittaker/Polymarket_arbitrage repo)\n2. **Python Package**: polymarket-apis (PyPI) claims to have get_top_users() and get_user_rank() methods for leaderboard data (windows: 1d/7d/30d/all, metrics: profit/volume, limit: max 100)\n3. **Third-party Scrapers**: Apify has Polymarket Leaderboard Scraper API\n4. **Undocumented Internal API**: Website uses internal endpoints that may not be publicly supported\n\n**Data Available from Leaderboard**:\n- Top traders by profit or volume\n- Time windows: daily, weekly, monthly, all-time\n- Wallet addresses\n- Usernames\n- P&L amounts\n- Rankings (max 100 traders)\n\n**Individual Trader Data**:\nOnce you have wallet addresses from leaderboard, use Data API:\n- GET /positions?user=<address> - current positions\n- GET /trades?user=<address> - trade history\n- GET /activity?user=<address> - onchain activity\n- GET /value?user=<address> - portfolio value\n\n**Recommendation**: Use polymarket-apis Python package as the most maintainable approach. Fallback to web scraping if needed. Monitor for official API updates.",

      "content": "Comprehensive research into Polymarket's liquidity rewards program for market makers, conducted for hypothesis hyp-003 testing.\n\n## PROGRAM STRUCTURE\n\n**Two Separate Programs**:\n1. **Liquidity Rewards** - For active market making (placing limit orders)\n2. **Holding Rewards** - 4% annualized for holding positions in 13 eligible long-term markets\n\n## LIQUIDITY REWARDS MECHANICS\n\n**Automatic Eligibility**: Market makers automatically qualify by posting resting limit orders\n\n**Reward Formula** (adapted from dYdX):\n- Quadratic scoring: closer to midpoint = exponentially higher rewards\n- Two-sided depth bonus: ~3x rewards for quotes on both sides vs single side\n- Per-market isolation: each market has separate reward pool\n- Daily distribution at midnight UTC\n\n**Key Parameters** (vary by market):\n- `max_incentive_spread`: Max distance from midpoint to qualify (e.g., 3 cents)\n- `min_incentive_size`: Minimum order size to earn rewards\n- Both fetchable via CLOB API and Markets API\n\n**Special Rules**:\n- Markets with midpoint < $0.10: MUST have orders on both sides to qualify\n- Minimum payout threshold: $1 (amounts below not paid)\n- Rewards tracked at polymarket.com/rewards\n\n## PROFITABILITY ANALYSIS\n\n**Income Sources**:\n1. Bid-ask spread capture\n2. Liquidity rewards\n3. Holding rewards (4% APY on position value)\n\n**Typical Bid-Ask Spreads**:\n- Liquid markets (major elections): 0.1 to 3 cents\n- Less liquid markets: 3 to 10+ cents\n- Display threshold: 10 cents (wider = show last trade price)\n\n**Reported Earnings**:\n- Basic market makers: $200-800/day during active periods\n- One case study: Started $10k capital → $200/day → scaled to $700-800/day peak\n- Expected margin: ~0.2% of trading volume\n- Example: $1M monthly volume → ~$2,000 profit from spread alone\n\n**Economics Calculation**:\n- Spread profit + LP rewards + 4% holding yield = combined 10-20%+ returns possible\n- Scalability: Quote dozens of markets simultaneously via bot\n- Competition: \"Not very fierce right now\" - strategy over speed\n\n## RISK FACTORS\n\n**Adverse Selection Risk**:\n- Informed traders can pick off stale quotes\n- Price movement risk during position holding\n- Need sophisticated pricing models\n\n**Capital Requirements**:\n- \"Pretty big bankroll to ride out swings\"\n- Need to manage inventory across multiple markets\n- Risk up to $300k mentioned by one sports MM\n\n**Program Changes**:\n- Post-2024 election: \"Total liquidity rewards decreased significantly\"\n- Reward rates are variable and subject to change\n- Per-market reward pools can be adjusted\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n**Reward Scoring Formula**:\nS(v,s) = ((v-s)/v)² × b\n\nWhere:\n- v = distance parameter\n- s = spread from midpoint\n- b = base size\n\n**Distribution Process**:\n1. Sample order book at intervals during epoch\n2. Calculate quadratic score per sample\n3. Aggregate scores over epoch\n4. Normalize against all participants\n5. Distribute proportional rewards\n\n**API Access**:\n- Fetch market parameters: CLOB API, Markets API\n- Track reward allocations: Markets API (per epoch)\n- No direct rewards API for historical earnings\n\n## HOLDING REWARDS PROGRAM\n\n**Separate 4% APY Program**:\n- 13 eligible markets (2026-2028 political/geopolitical events)\n- Position value = (Yes shares × mid) + (No shares × mid)\n- Hourly sampling, daily distribution\n- Example: $20,400 position → $0.093/hour → ~$2.23/day\n\n## HYP-003 ASSESSMENT\n\n**\"Risk-Free\" Claim Evaluation**:\n- NOT truly risk-free due to adverse selection and price risk\n- CAN be +EV if: rewards > expected adverse selection losses\n- Best opportunities: Low-volatility + high-reward markets\n- Requires: Capital, sophisticated models, speed\n\n**Actionable Strategy**:\n1. Identify markets with high reward/spread ratios\n2. Build automated quoting system\n3. Focus on two-sided liquidity for 3x bonus\n4. Monitor inventory risk across positions\n5. Test with small capital first\n\n**Current Viability** (Dec 2025):\n- Post-election reward reduction noted\n- Competition increasing but not yet fierce\n- Still profitable for sophisticated operators\n- Need to monitor ongoing reward rate changes\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nLiquidity rewards create genuine +EV opportunities but are NOT risk-free. Success requires:\n- Capital (tens of thousands minimum)\n- Automated execution (bots)\n- Sophisticated pricing models\n- Risk management across positions\n- Continuous monitoring of reward parameters\n\nThe 3x bonus for two-sided quotes and quadratic proximity scoring create structural advantages for tight, balanced market making. Combined with 4% holding rewards, total returns of 10-20%+ are achievable but require professional-grade infrastructure.",

Research-heavy, execution-light**\n- 7 hypotheses generated, only 1 trade executed\n- System spending too much time on research, not enough on testing with actual paper trades\n- At this rate, insufficient data to validate any hypothesis statistically\n\n**2. No formal strategies**\n- Trading directly on hypotheses without formalizing into strategies\n- No clear entry/exit rules codified until this review\n- Created strat-001 to address this\n\n**3. Infrastructure blocking multiple hypotheses**\n- hyp-003 (MM) needs automated quoting\n- hyp-004 (Leaderboard) needs data scraping\n- hyp-006 (Sports) needs cross-platform price comparison\n- These hypotheses stuck in \"proposed\" due to missing tools\n\n**4. Active position underwater**\n- trade-001: AAPL entry at 9¢, now at 7.3¢ (-19%)\n- Hypothesis that close fundamentals = close probabilities appears weak\n- Market efficiently prices momentum/narrative factors we underweighted\n\n### What IS Working\n\n**1. Scientific rigor**\n- Clear hypothesis statements, rationale, test methods\n- Evidence tracking with confidence impacts\n- Proper invalidation of hyp-001 (tail-risk overpricing)\n\n**2. Risk management**\n- Conservative position sizing (5% of capital)\n- Defined stop-loss (4¢)\n- Position still 82% above stop-loss\n\n**3. Learning accumulation**\n- High-quality learnings documented (API access, liquidity rewards, agent patterns)\n- Building knowledge base for future decisions\n\n### Key Insights\n\n1. **Close fundamentals ≠ Close probabilities**: Markets price momentum, narrative, and catalysts - not just current state\n\n2. **Don't bet against momentum without catalyst**: NVDA has strong narrative; AAPL needs specific catalyst to close gap\n\n3. **Trade velocity matters**: Can't validate hypotheses without trades. Paper money is cheap - use it.\n\n4. **Prioritize low-infrastructure hypotheses**: hyp-007 (related market arbitrage) is executable NOW without new tools\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. **Increase trade velocity**: Execute more paper trades to test hypotheses rather than endlessly researching\n\n2. **Prioritize actionable hypotheses**: Focus on hyp-007 (arbitrage) that doesn't need new infrastructure\n\n3. **Formalize all active hypotheses into strategies**: Clear entry/exit rules before trading\n\n4. **Don't bet against market momentum** without specific catalysts or information edge\n\n5. **Queue infrastructure requests for blocking hypotheses**: Handoff to Agent Engineer for hyp-003, hyp-004, hyp-006 tools",

This looked like momentum away from leader. But 3 hours later, prices reverted to baseline.\n\n2. **24-hour stability**: After full 24h, Time POY prices nearly identical to baseline (AI 39%, Jensen 21%, Sam Altman down 1pp from 14% to 13%, Trump +0.1pp). No clear momentum pattern.\n\n3. **AAPL position**: Largest Company market shows AAPL slowly declining (9% → 7.4% over 2 days) while NVDA stable at 91%. This could be momentum toward incumbent OR simply efficient price discovery.\n\n**Key insight**: Short-term price movements (hours) appear to be noise/mean-reversion.

Mid prices summed to only 97.75%, suggesting a 2.25% arbitrage opportunity (buy all 12, guaranteed $1 payout, profit 2.3%).\n\n**The Reality:**\nWhen checking actual ASK prices (what you'd pay to buy):\n- Google: 79.5% mid → 80.0% ask (+0.5%)\n- OpenAI: 12.1% mid → 12.8% ask (+0.7%)\n- xAI: 4.05% mid → 4.2% ask (+0.15%)\n- etc.\n\nActual cost to buy all 12: ~99.7%, leaving only 0.3% profit.\n\n**Why This Happens:**\n- Mid price = (bid + ask) / 2\n- You BUY at ask, SELL at bid\n- Market makers set spreads to capture this gap\n- The 'arbitrage' IS the spread that market makers extract\n\n**Key Insight:**\nMarket makers have already priced in cross-market relationships.

      "title": "First Loss: Volatility Mispricing Hypothesis Failed - Markets Price Momentum, Not Just Fundamentals",
      "content": "**Trade Details:**\n- Position: AAPL YES @ 9¢ (5,555 shares, $500 cost)\n- Exit: 6.6¢ (after price dropped 27% from entry)\n- Loss: -$133.30 (-26.7%)\n- Duration: ~2 days\n\n**Original Thesis (hyp-005):**\nMulti-outcome markets with close competitors misprice volatility. AAPL market cap was only 5-7% behind NVDA, but Polymarket priced AAPL at 9% vs NVDA at 89%. Hypothesis: markets underweight the probability of reversals.\n\n**Why It Failed:**\n\n1. **Momentum matters more than current state**: Market cap closeness (AAPL ~5-7% behind) doesn't translate to probability closeness. NVDA had momentum, narrative (AI leader), and no catalyst for reversal. Markets correctly price these factors.\n\n2. **Gap widened, not narrowed**: Over 2 days, NVDA went from 90% → 92% while AAPL dropped from 9% → 6.5%. The market cap gap actually expanded (NVDA ~$4.5T vs AAPL ~$4.1T = 8-10% gap).\n\n3. **No catalyst**: Betting against a trend requires a specific reason for reversal. 'Volatility could close the gap' is hope, not edge. Without a catalyst (earnings surprise, product announcement, regulatory news), momentum continues.\n\n4. **Markets approaching resolution become MORE efficient**: As the Dec 31 deadline approaches, prices converge toward the likely outcome. Less time = less uncertainty = tighter spreads around the expected winner.\n\n**Key Learnings:**\n\n1. **Close fundamentals ≠ Close probabilities**: Momentum, narrative, and catalysts matter as much as current state.\n\n2. **Don't bet against momentum without edge**: Need specific information advantage or upcoming catalyst to justify contrarian bet.\n\n3. **Exit before stop-loss when thesis invalidates**: Price dropped 27% but was still 65% above 4¢ stop-loss. Exited early because thesis failed, not because of mechanical stop.\n\n4. **Paper trading teaches real lessons**: Even with fake money, the loss highlights a systematic error in reasoning.\n\n**What Would Have Worked Instead:**\n- Bet WITH momentum (NVDA YES at 90-92¢)\n- Wait for specific AAPL catalyst before entering\n- Use options-like structure (smaller position, more leverage on specific event)\n\n**Impact on Future Trading:**\n- Invalidated hyp-005 (volatility mispricing in close races)\n- Added skepticism to contrarian bets without catalysts\n- Reinforced: Markets are more efficient than they appear",

KEY FINDINGS: (1) Genuine +EV opportunity - 30-50% APY with $10k+ capital after adverse selection costs, (2) Daily rewards $2-5 per market, reported $200-800/day at scale (50-100 markets), (3) Adverse selection costs 70-90% of gross spread - biggest expense, (4) Infrastructure barrier: 4-7 week development for competitive bot (WebSocket feeds, automated orders, inventory tracking), (5) Capital requirements: $10k minimum for diversification across 80-100 markets, $1k insufficient, $5k marginal, (6) Competition not saturated - 1-2 bots per market currently but Polymarket building in-house MM team (Dec 2025), (7) Breakeven spread: 0.2-0.5¢ captured on markets with $1k+ daily turnover, (8) Two-sided quotes earn 3x rewards (confirmed), quadratic scoring favors tight spreads, (9) Post-election reward reduction confirmed but not quantified. RECOMMENDATION: DEFER - high infrastructure barrier vs faster-to-test hypotheses (sports, momentum, Fed-CME arbitrage). Revisit after validating 2-3 simpler strategies.
