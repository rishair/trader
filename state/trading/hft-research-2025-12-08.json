  "question": "What high-frequency trading (HFT) strategies are viable on Polymarket, and what infrastructure/edges are needed to execute them profitably?",
  "researchDate": "2025-12-08",
  "summary": "Polymarket offers viable HFT opportunities across 4 primary strategies: arbitrage (most accessible, $40M extracted historically), market making (requires capital + automation), spike trading (micro-movements), and statistical arbitrage (mean reversion). Competition is moderate but growing. Infrastructure requirements range from basic (API + bot) to advanced (sub-100ms latency, automated quoting). Arbitrage opportunities persist but last only seconds, captured primarily by bots on Polygon nodes. Market making remains profitable ($200-800/day reported) but post-election rewards decreased significantly. Key edge: speed + sophistication, not yet saturated by HFT firms.",

  "insights": [
    {
      "insight": "Arbitrage is the most accessible HFT strategy on Polymarket, with $40M extracted historically",
      "detail": "Two types exist: (1) Single-market rebalancing where YES+NO prices ≠ $1.00, and (2) Combinatorial arbitrage across related markets (synonym markets, dependent outcomes). Academic study found top 3 arbitrage wallets earned $4.2M from 10,200+ bets over one year. Most opportunities yield 1-5% but can reach 5% in 15 minutes. Opportunities last only seconds today, requiring bot-based execution.",

    "How has competition changed from the IMDEA study period (Apr 2024-Apr 2025) to now (Dec 2025)?",
    "Are there any traditional HFT firms operating on Polymarket that maintain stealth?",

  "methodology": "7-phase research protocol: (1) Question scoping to clarify HFT viability on Polymarket, (2) Retrieval planning across 6 subtopics, (3) Iterative querying with 15+ web searches and 5+ deep fetches, (4) Source triangulation with quality ratings (A-E scale), (5) Synthesis into structured insights, (6) Self-critique identifying unverified claims, (7) Final output with actionable recommendations. Sources cross-verified: CLOB specs (official docs + GitHub), arbitrage profits (academic study + journalism), market making (case study + open source code), infrastructure (Alchemy case study + RPC provider research).",

  "keyTakeaways": [
    "Arbitrage is most accessible HFT strategy: $40M extracted historically, 1-5% returns per trade, but opportunities now last only seconds",
    "Market making can generate $200-800/day but requires $50K+ capital, sophisticated models, and automation. Post-election rewards decreased.",
    "Competition is moderate: sophisticated bots exist but not traditional HFT firms. 'One or two bots per market' vs DeFi saturation.",
    "Infrastructure is HFT-friendly: Sub-100ms latency achievable, 240/s order rate limits, <$0.01 gas fees, WebSocket real-time feeds.",
    "Open source implementations exist for arbitrage, market making, and spike trading - low barrier to experimentation.",
    "Edge sustainability varies: Speed-based edges (arbitrage) partially saturated. Model-based edges (MM, stat arb) less saturated.",
    "Start with arbitrage to test infrastructure and execution, then graduate to market making or statistical arbitrage for sustainable edge."
