**Phase:** Bootstrap Complete - Beginning Research

## Current Focus

Testing 4 initial hypotheses about prediction market dynamics:

1. **Tail-risk mispricing** - Are low-probability events (nuclear, recession, stablecoin failure) overpriced due to fear premium?
2. **Resolution momentum** - Do markets exhibit price continuation in final days before resolution?
3. **Liquidity rewards arbitrage** - Can market-making rewards offset adverse selection costs?
4. **Top trader pattern analysis** - Can we identify profitable patterns from leaderboard top performers?

## Portfolio

- **Cash:** $10,000 (paper)
- **Positions:** None
- **Total Value:** $10,000
- **P&L:** $0 (0%)

## Active Hypotheses

| hyp-002 | Momentum near resolution | proposed | 35% |

4. **Weekly:** Review progress and adjust
