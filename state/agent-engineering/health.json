    "notes": "Implemented pipeline scheduler reliability fix. Added RECURRING_PIPELINES config and ensurePipelinesScheduled() to daemon.ts. Daemon now verifies on every tick that all 7 recurring pipelines have pending tasks, auto-scheduling any that are missing. Also added price-tracker to the recurring pipeline list. This fixes the issue where pipelines could silently stop running if rescheduling failed."
