      "title": "Polymarket Leaderboard API Access Methods",
      "content": "Research into accessing Polymarket leaderboard data programmatically revealed several key findings:\n\n**NO PUBLIC DIRECT API**: Polymarket does not provide a publicly documented REST API endpoint for leaderboard data. The gamma-api.polymarket.com and data-api.polymarket.com do not include leaderboard endpoints.\n\n**Available Documented APIs**:\n- Gamma API (gamma-api.polymarket.com): Markets, events, tags - NO leaderboard\n- Data API (data-api.polymarket.com): /positions, /trades, /activity, /holders, /value - trader-specific but NOT leaderboard rankings\n- CLOB API (clob.polymarket.com): Trading operations only\n\n**Alternative Access Methods**:\n1. **Web Scraping**: The leaderboard at polymarket.com/leaderboard/* is rendered via Next.js SSG. Can be scraped using Selenium/BeautifulSoup (see JeremyWhittaker/Polymarket_arbitrage repo)\n2. **Python Package**: polymarket-apis (PyPI) claims to have get_top_users() and get_user_rank() methods for leaderboard data (windows: 1d/7d/30d/all, metrics: profit/volume, limit: max 100)\n3. **Third-party Scrapers**: Apify has Polymarket Leaderboard Scraper API\n4. **Undocumented Internal API**: Website uses internal endpoints that may not be publicly supported\n\n**Data Available from Leaderboard**:\n- Top traders by profit or volume\n- Time windows: daily, weekly, monthly, all-time\n- Wallet addresses\n- Usernames\n- P&L amounts\n- Rankings (max 100 traders)\n\n**Individual Trader Data**:\nOnce you have wallet addresses from leaderboard, use Data API:\n- GET /positions?user=<address> - current positions\n- GET /trades?user=<address> - trade history\n- GET /activity?user=<address> - onchain activity\n- GET /value?user=<address> - portfolio value\n\n**Recommendation**: Use polymarket-apis Python package as the most maintainable approach. Fallback to web scraping if needed. Monitor for official API updates.",

      "title": "Polymarket Liquidity Rewards Program: Structure and Profitability Analysis",
      "content": "Comprehensive research into Polymarket's liquidity rewards program for market makers, conducted for hypothesis hyp-003 testing.\n\n## PROGRAM STRUCTURE\n\n**Two Separate Programs**:\n1. **Liquidity Rewards** - For active market making (placing limit orders)\n2. **Holding Rewards** - 4% annualized for holding positions in 13 eligible long-term markets\n\n## LIQUIDITY REWARDS MECHANICS\n\n**Automatic Eligibility**: Market makers automatically qualify by posting resting limit orders\n\n**Reward Formula** (adapted from dYdX):\n- Quadratic scoring: closer to midpoint = exponentially higher rewards\n- Two-sided depth bonus: ~3x rewards for quotes on both sides vs single side\n- Per-market isolation: each market has separate reward pool\n- Daily distribution at midnight UTC\n\n**Key Parameters** (vary by market):\n- `max_incentive_spread`: Max distance from midpoint to qualify (e.g., 3 cents)\n- `min_incentive_size`: Minimum order size to earn rewards\n- Both fetchable via CLOB API and Markets API\n\n**Special Rules**:\n- Markets with midpoint < $0.10: MUST have orders on both sides to qualify\n- Minimum payout threshold: $1 (amounts below not paid)\n- Rewards tracked at polymarket.com/rewards\n\n## PROFITABILITY ANALYSIS\n\n**Income Sources**:\n1. Bid-ask spread capture\n2. Liquidity rewards\n3. Holding rewards (4% APY on position value)\n\n**Typical Bid-Ask Spreads**:\n- Liquid markets (major elections): 0.1 to 3 cents\n- Less liquid markets: 3 to 10+ cents\n- Display threshold: 10 cents (wider = show last trade price)\n\n**Reported Earnings**:\n- Basic market makers: $200-800/day during active periods\n- One case study: Started $10k capital → $200/day → scaled to $700-800/day peak\n- Expected margin: ~0.2% of trading volume\n- Example: $1M monthly volume → ~$2,000 profit from spread alone\n\n**Economics Calculation**:\n- Spread profit + LP rewards + 4% holding yield = combined 10-20%+ returns possible\n- Scalability: Quote dozens of markets simultaneously via bot\n- Competition: \"Not very fierce right now\" - strategy over speed\n\n## RISK FACTORS\n\n**Adverse Selection Risk**:\n- Informed traders can pick off stale quotes\n- Price movement risk during position holding\n- Need sophisticated pricing models\n\n**Capital Requirements**:\n- \"Pretty big bankroll to ride out swings\"\n- Need to manage inventory across multiple markets\n- Risk up to $300k mentioned by one sports MM\n\n**Program Changes**:\n- Post-2024 election: \"Total liquidity rewards decreased significantly\"\n- Reward rates are variable and subject to change\n- Per-market reward pools can be adjusted\n\n## TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\n**Reward Scoring Formula**:\nS(v,s) = ((v-s)/v)² × b\n\nWhere:\n- v = distance parameter\n- s = spread from midpoint\n- b = base size\n\n**Distribution Process**:\n1. Sample order book at intervals during epoch\n2. Calculate quadratic score per sample\n3. Aggregate scores over epoch\n4. Normalize against all participants\n5. Distribute proportional rewards\n\n**API Access**:\n- Fetch market parameters: CLOB API, Markets API\n- Track reward allocations: Markets API (per epoch)\n- No direct rewards API for historical earnings\n\n## HOLDING REWARDS PROGRAM\n\n**Separate 4% APY Program**:\n- 13 eligible markets (2026-2028 political/geopolitical events)\n- Position value = (Yes shares × mid) + (No shares × mid)\n- Hourly sampling, daily distribution\n- Example: $20,400 position → $0.093/hour → ~$2.23/day\n\n## HYP-003 ASSESSMENT\n\n**\"Risk-Free\" Claim Evaluation**:\n- NOT truly risk-free due to adverse selection and price risk\n- CAN be +EV if: rewards > expected adverse selection losses\n- Best opportunities: Low-volatility + high-reward markets\n- Requires: Capital, sophisticated models, speed\n\n**Actionable Strategy**:\n1. Identify markets with high reward/spread ratios\n2. Build automated quoting system\n3. Focus on two-sided liquidity for 3x bonus\n4. Monitor inventory risk across positions\n5. Test with small capital first\n\n**Current Viability** (Dec 2025):\n- Post-election reward reduction noted\n- Competition increasing but not yet fierce\n- Still profitable for sophisticated operators\n- Need to monitor ongoing reward rate changes\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nLiquidity rewards create genuine +EV opportunities but are NOT risk-free. Success requires:\n- Capital (tens of thousands minimum)\n- Automated execution (bots)\n- Sophisticated pricing models\n- Risk management across positions\n- Continuous monitoring of reward parameters\n\nThe 3x bonus for two-sided quotes and quadratic proximity scoring create structural advantages for tight, balanced market making. Combined with 4% holding rewards, total returns of 10-20%+ are achievable but require professional-grade infrastructure.",
