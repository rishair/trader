      "title": "Polymarket Leaderboard API Access Methods",
      "content": "Research into accessing Polymarket leaderboard data programmatically revealed several key findings:\n\n**NO PUBLIC DIRECT API**: Polymarket does not provide a publicly documented REST API endpoint for leaderboard data. The gamma-api.polymarket.com and data-api.polymarket.com do not include leaderboard endpoints.\n\n**Available Documented APIs**:\n- Gamma API (gamma-api.polymarket.com): Markets, events, tags - NO leaderboard\n- Data API (data-api.polymarket.com): /positions, /trades, /activity, /holders, /value - trader-specific but NOT leaderboard rankings\n- CLOB API (clob.polymarket.com): Trading operations only\n\n**Alternative Access Methods**:\n1. **Web Scraping**: The leaderboard at polymarket.com/leaderboard/* is rendered via Next.js SSG. Can be scraped using Selenium/BeautifulSoup (see JeremyWhittaker/Polymarket_arbitrage repo)\n2. **Python Package**: polymarket-apis (PyPI) claims to have get_top_users() and get_user_rank() methods for leaderboard data (windows: 1d/7d/30d/all, metrics: profit/volume, limit: max 100)\n3. **Third-party Scrapers**: Apify has Polymarket Leaderboard Scraper API\n4. **Undocumented Internal API**: Website uses internal endpoints that may not be publicly supported\n\n**Data Available from Leaderboard**:\n- Top traders by profit or volume\n- Time windows: daily, weekly, monthly, all-time\n- Wallet addresses\n- Usernames\n- P&L amounts\n- Rankings (max 100 traders)\n\n**Individual Trader Data**:\nOnce you have wallet addresses from leaderboard, use Data API:\n- GET /positions?user=<address> - current positions\n- GET /trades?user=<address> - trade history\n- GET /activity?user=<address> - onchain activity\n- GET /value?user=<address> - portfolio value\n\n**Recommendation**: Use polymarket-apis Python package as the most maintainable approach. Fallback to web scraping if needed. Monitor for official API updates.",
